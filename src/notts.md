This is a really comprehensive summary of your brainstorming session and user feedback for Structurizr! You've gathered a lot of valuable insights. Based on what you've shared, here are some thoughts on the key things to pick up and potential improvements to discuss:

Key Things to Pick Up from Your Feedback:

Core Value is Strong, but User Experience is a Major Hurdle:

Pick Up: Users love the core capability of Structurizr â€“ defining architecture with DSL and visualizing it, especially for governance. This is your biggest strength.

However: The UI/UX is consistently cited as a major pain point across different user groups (unclear, unintuitive, not collaborative, difficult sharing, overwhelming). This is likely a primary barrier to wider adoption and satisfaction.

Collaboration is a Critical, Underdeveloped Need:

Pick Up: Multiple personas (Junior Dev, Senior Dev) explicitly mentioned the need for better collaboration features. The current state is perceived as lacking or too rigid for effective teamwork.

Essential Technical Features are Missing for Power Users & Scalability:

Pick Up: The lack of DSL version control is a significant gap. Issues like no intellisense, and the tool not being mature/flexible enough for complex use cases or large enterprises, are holding back more advanced adoption.

User Personas Have Distinct but Overlapping Needs:

Pick Up:

Junior Devs: Need better onboarding, ease of use, and basic collaboration to get started and learn.

Senior Devs: Need robust C4 modeling, advanced sharing/collaboration across teams, and capabilities for complex architectures.

System Engineers/Internal Owners: Focus on reliability, maintainability, scalability, enterprise readiness, and improving the open-source offering. Addressing their concerns is key for platform health.

Clear Desire for Growth & Improvement:

Pick Up: Your team's goal to grow Structurizr, increase adoption, and add genuinely useful features is well-aligned with the user feedback. There's a clear mandate for change.

Potential Improvements to Discuss for Structurizr:

Based on these takeaways, here are areas for improvement you could discuss:

UI/UX Overhaul & Ease of Use:

Discuss: How can the UI be redesigned for better clarity, intuitiveness, and navigation (especially around workspace creation and management)?

Discuss: Implementing workspace previews (as requested).

Discuss: Simplifying the process for sharing workspaces and managing permissions.

Discuss: Making language references much more accessible and integrated.

Discuss: Creating interactive onboarding guides or tutorials within the platform.

Enhanced Collaboration Features:

Discuss: What would meaningful collaboration look like? (e.g., commenting on diagrams, concurrent editing if feasible, better asynchronous workflows, version history for collaborative changes beyond just DSL).

Discuss: Features to support cross-team/cross-fleet collaboration as highlighted by Senior Developers.

Core Technical & Developer Experience Enhancements:

Discuss: DSL Version Control: This seems like a high-priority item. How can it be integrated (e.g., Git-based)?

Discuss: Adding Intellisense or improved DSL editing support.

Discuss: How to make Structurizr less "rigid" and more adaptable to complex use cases or enterprise needs (e.g., extensibility, configuration).

Discuss: Improving the reliability, maintainability, and scalability for large enterprise deployments (System Engineer concerns).

Adoption, Community, and Open Source:

Discuss: How can you better support the open-source version and encourage contributions, potentially aligning with enterprise features?

Discuss: Strategies to ensure new features are genuinely "used by people," perhaps through more iterative feedback loops with your personas.

Discuss: Improving API/CLI for automation and integration with other tools (like the Docusaurus example).

Is Structurizr "as-is" or is there a lot to incorporate to make it better?

Based on your detailed feedback, there is absolutely a lot you can incorporate to make Structurizr significantly better.

It's not just an "as-is" tool that's reached its peak. While it has a valuable core, the feedback clearly indicates that its current state has significant friction points and missing capabilities that hinder user satisfaction and broader adoption.

The good news is that the pain points are quite clear, and the desired improvements are largely consistent across your user feedback. This gives you a strong direction.

Addressing these areas has the potential to transform Structurizr from a tool that people use (sometimes despite its flaws) into one they genuinely love and advocate for.

Your team is on the right track by gathering this feedback. The next step is to prioritize these areas and start discussing concrete solutions! Good luck!
